## SOLID Principles

- ***S - Single Responsibility Principle*** <br>
- ***O - Open/Closed Principle*** <br>
- ***L - Liskov Substituion Principle*** <br>
- ***I - Interface Segregation Principle*** <br>
- ***D - Dependency Inversion*** <br>
<br>

The above program follows all the SOLID principles.

<br>
S - Single Repsonsibilty Principle
    An object should only have one reason to change.

O - Open Closed Principle
    Open for extension, closed for modification.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle
    Passing an object’s inheritor in place of the base class shouldn’t break 
    any existing functionality in the called method.

I - Interface Segregation Principle
    Each interface should have a specific purpose.

D - Dependency Inversion Principle
    Dependency Inversion means to depend on abstractions instead of concrete types.
